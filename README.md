Installation
------------
Create a virtual Python environment (for more info, see [venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

In short, create the environment with

    python -m venv .venv

where `.venv` is the directory where you want to store your virtual environment.
Activate the environment with one of the following commands, depending on your shell:

    # bash
    source </path/to/new/virtual/environment>/bin/activate

    # Windows cmd.exe
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    pip install -r requirements.txt
